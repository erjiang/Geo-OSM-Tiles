* Portability:
  Allow an alternate separator (maybe ':' instead of '&') in the
  --link command line argument to downloadosmtiles.pl.  MSWin32 seem
  to have problems passing command line arguments to a script
  containing '&'.

  Still have to decide whether we support this silently or add an
  extra compatibility command line switch to turn this on.

  Document the portability issues revealed by cpan testers in the
  README.

* Build:
  Support Module::Build as an alternative to ExtUtils::MakeMaker.

* Feature:
  Allow on the fly rescaling of tiles.  E.g. a tile for zoom level n
  will be zoomed by 200% (using Image::Magick or Graphics::Magick or
  something alike), cut into four, and stored as four tiles of zoom
  level n+1.

  Problem: Image::Magick or Graphics::Magick is quite a heavy
  prerequisite given that Geo::OSM::Tiles is also used on handheld
  devices.  Consider to make this feature configurable at build time.
