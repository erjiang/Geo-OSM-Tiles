* Build:
  Support Module::Build as an alternative to ExtUtils::MakeMaker.

* Feature:
  Allow on the fly rescaling of tiles.  E.g. a tile for zoom level n
  will be zoomed by 200% (using Image::Magick or Graphics::Magick or
  something alike), cut into four, and stored as four tiles of zoom
  level n+1.

  Problem: Image::Magick or Graphics::Magick is quite a heavy
  prerequisite given that Geo::OSM::Tiles is also used on handheld
  devices.  Consider to make this feature configurable at build time.
