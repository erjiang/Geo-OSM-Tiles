        - Portability fixes: use File::Spec to compose file names,
	  fix passing of command line arguments to the script under
	  MSWin32 (thanks to Ekkehard Horner for the hint).

	  Note that i do not have access to other platforms then Linux
	  for testing.  I have to rely on the reports from CPAN
	  testers for any portability issues.  Thanks folks, your
	  input is greatly appreciated!
